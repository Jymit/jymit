- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with
- 😄 Pronouns:
-->
- 🤔 It's pronouced jim-it
- 💻 In the past ive worked closely on full stack Open Source Software Engineering notably @ [Zimbra](https://www.zimbra.com/), [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/)
- 🛡️ At present working in SOC Security Engineering at Scale
- 🔭 I’m working on consolidating some years of notes ive used for work and fun into an organised tidy space. Oh and trying to drop daily commits in 2022. Clearly missed a bunch due to unplanned circumstances
- 🌱 I currently have an interest in learning macOS security (R&D)
- 🤔 To which, I’m always looking for any new knowledge to do with macOS internals and security - Hoping to attend [OBTSv5](https://objectivebythesea.org/v5/) later this year - cerveza!
- ⚡ I like to solve problems, I like to help others solve problems they may have, be it people, software, network, architecture, security or anything really
- 💬 Ask me Anything
- 📫 How to reach me 🤔. Where can you find me first?

## Current Research
macOS Security Research
### CVEs
WIP - Still learning to get something down, hopefully one this year!?
- [SANS FOR610](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/reverse-engineering-malware-malware-analysis-tools-techniques/) & [macOS Control Bypasses](https://www.offensive-security.com/exp312-osmr/) underway at ones own pace
### Technical Writeups in progress
TBD - In draft -	https://medium.com/@jkhondhu
### Something about nothing
- Life Long Learning (a must)
- There cannot be any learning without teaching/mentoring (reach out to talk about tech and cyber)
- Some SANS, Some GIACs
- Along with some experience in different tech spaces
### To Do list (areas I have or am reading about and or want to pursue, implement in some shape or form)
- [Detection as Code DaC](https://www.tines.com/blog/automating-detection-as-code)
- [AWS Guardduty](https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/features/) - innerworkings
- Working out [time complexity](https://adrianmejia.com/how-to-find-time-complexity-of-an-algorithm-code-big-o-notation) because being able to think or work like a swe is never a bad idea
- Apple Endpoint Security Framework ESF - Talk from [BSides Munich](https://youtu.be/XNFU9296_r0?t=139) by Connor Morley
### Recent reads, recommendations
- [SANS SOC Survey 2022](https://go.chronicle.security/hubfs/SANS_2022_SOC_Survey.pdf) 
- [Sec updates from AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/) - sort by sec tool of choice - eg. New ML Rules added to Guardduty
