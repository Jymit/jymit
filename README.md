- 🛡️ At present working in SecOps Security Engineering at scale
- 🔭 Working on consolidating some years of notes as well as some of the new stuff im learning and fun into an organised tidy space. Trying and failing to drop daily commits in 2022. Missed a bunch due to unplanned circumstances

## Current Research
macOS Security Research
### CVEs
WIP - Still learning to get something down, hopefully one this year!?
- [SANS FOR610](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/reverse-engineering-malware-malware-analysis-tools-techniques/) & [macOS Control Bypasses](https://www.offensive-security.com/exp312-osmr/) underway at ones own pace
### Technical Writeups in progress
WIP time permitting/TBD - In draft -	https://medium.com/@jkhondhu
### Something about nothing
- Life Long Learning (a must)
- There cannot be any learning without teaching/mentoring (reach out to talk about tech and cyber)
- Some SANS, Some GIACs
- Along with some experience in different tech spaces
#### To update below to be more up to date
### To Do list (areas I have or am reading about and or want to pursue, implement in some shape or form)
- [Detection as Code DaC](https://www.tines.com/blog/automating-detection-as-code)
- [AWS Guardduty](https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/features/) - innerworkings
- Working out [time complexity](https://adrianmejia.com/how-to-find-time-complexity-of-an-algorithm-code-big-o-notation) because being able to think or work like a swe is never a bad idea
- Apple Endpoint Security Framework ESF - Talk from [BSides Munich](https://youtu.be/XNFU9296_r0?t=139) by Connor Morley
### Recent reads, recommendations
