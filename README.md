### Hey! Jymit here.
<!--
**Jymit/jymit** is a ‚ú® _special_ ‚ú® repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile
Here are some ideas to get you started:
- üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on 
- ü§î I‚Äôm looking for help with
- üòÑ Pronouns:
-->
- ü§î It's pronouced Jim-it
- üíª In the past ive worked closely on full stack Open Source Software Engineering notably @ [Zimbra](https://www.zimbra.com/), [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/)
- üõ°Ô∏è At present working in SecOps Security Engineering at scale
- üî≠ Working on consolidating some years of notes as well as some of the new stuff im learning and fun into an organised tidy space. Trying and failing to drop daily commits in ~~2022~~. Missed a bunch due to unplanned circumstances.
- üå± I have an interest in macOS security research
- ü§î To which, I‚Äôm always looking for any new knowledge to do with macOS internals and security - Attended [OBTSv5](https://objectivebythesea.org/v5/) and looking forward to [OBTSv6](https://objectivebythesea.org/v6/index.html).
- ‚ö° I like to solve problems, I like to help others solve problems they may have, be it people, software, network, architecture, security...
- üí¨ Ask me Anything
- üì´ How to reach me ü§î. Where can you find me first?

## Currently ~~Research~~ Learning
macOS Security Research
### CVEs
WIP - hopefully soon!?
- [GIAC GIME](https://www.giac.org/certifications/ios-macos-examiner-gime/) recently accaccomplished, maybe take on [macOS Control Bypasses](https://www.offensive-security.com/exp312-osmr/) next, however might take on learning and instrument first.
### Technical Writeups in progress
WIP time permitting - Hoping to draft a couple in the next 9-12 months on	[medium](https://medium.com/@jkhondhu), current ideas are for non technical pieces, thinking social anxiety and working in tech, leadership styles, and empathy as a leader.
### Something about nothing
- Life Long Learning (a must)
- There cannot be any learning without teaching or mentoring (reach out to talk about tech and cyber). Hoping to start doing even more of both in 2023-24, stay tuned.
- Some SANS, Some GIACs (who doesnt now a days)
- Along with some experience in different tech spaces
#### To improve the below as time goes on
### To Do list (areas I have or am reading about and or want to pursue, implement in some shape or form)
- macOS internals / malware / writing and learning my own escapes
- Working out [time complexity](https://adrianmejia.com/how-to-find-time-complexity-of-an-algorithm-code-big-o-notation) because being able to think or work like a swe is never a bad idea
### Recent reading, recommendations
- Apple Endpoint Security Framework ESF - Talk from [BSides Munich](https://youtu.be/XNFU9296_r0?t=139) by Connor Morley
- [Sec updates from AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/) - filter by security tool of choice - eg. AWS Security Hub launches 7 new security controls
