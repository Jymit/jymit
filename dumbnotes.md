## scripting languages
A scripting language or script language is a programming language for a runtime system that automates the execution of tasks that would otherwise be performed individually by a human operator. Scripting languages are usually interpreted at runtime rather than compiled.

The action of scripting is essentially writing a series of commands that are interpreted one by one by an application or scripting engine. Even though the script guides the platform through what to do (gives it a script to read and interpret), the execution is performed by the runtime environment and not by the scripting language itself.

## Platform-Specific vs Platform-Agnostic
Scripting languages are platform-specific, while programming languages are platform-agnostic (cross-platform) as they have the ability to execute themselves. For instance, you can run a Java program on any operating system.

## Interpreted vs Compiled
While programming languages are compiled, scripting languages are mostly interpreted — even though there are some scripting languages that are both compiled and interpreted, such as Python and Groovy.

‘Compiled’ means that a programming language has its own compiler that translates the syntax into machine code before runtime. In contrast, scripting languages are interpreted line by line during runtime by the interpreter of the platform they are running on.

## Scripting vs Programming Languages
Platform-specific - 	Platform-agnostic (cross-platform)
(Mostly) interpreted - 	Compiled
Faster at runtime -	Slower at runtime
More code-intensive -	Less code-intensive
Creates standalone apps -	Creates apps as part of a stack








## Objective-C
```
Objective-C is the primary programming language you use when writing software for OS X and iOS. It’s a superset of the C programming language and provides object-oriented capabilities and a dynamic runtime. Objective-C inherits the syntax, primitive types, and flow control statements of C and adds syntax for defining classes and methods. It also adds language-level support for object graph management and object literals while providing dynamic typing and binding, deferring many responsibilities until runtime.
